<h1>Is Lebron still the King?</h1>

<p>After 15 years of being one of the most durable superstars in NBA history, <a href="http://www.lebronjames.com" target="_blank">James</a> showed signs of wear in 2018-19, missing a career-high 27 games. When James was on the floor last season, his production spoke for itself. But James will need to stay healthy — and engaged — for his fantasy potential to come to fruition. The addition of Anthony Davis should help breathe new life into the four-time MVP, and reports that he may end up serving as the Lakers' starting point guard will only boost his already gaudy assists numbers.</p>

<p>With little over a month before the end of the season, however, it appears increasingly likely that LeBron will instead be on holiday by the time the playoffs begin, while Luke Walton could well be looking for a new employer.</p>
